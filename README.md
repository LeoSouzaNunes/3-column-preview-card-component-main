## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

As my first experience with SASS I was able to apply SASS resources.

### Continued development

I intend to keep using SASS in my next projects to keep improving it and make some project in React.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - This helped me to check some properties that I could apply.
